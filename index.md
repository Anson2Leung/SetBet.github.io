## Overview


## Game Introduction
Set Bet is a deck-builder roguelike that takes inspiration from games like Balatro and Dicey Dungeon. The player must defeat their enemies by placing down bets that can trigger a variety of effects, like copying adjacent bets, drawing cards, and so on (aside from dealing damage). These effects are triggered if the appropriate conditions are met, the most basic one is having a stronger poker hand than the opponent. Currently, the game features an endless set of enemies with randomized bets that scale in health with each win, so see how far you can get.

## Next Steps
1. Improved enemy AI that decides on what bets to play and what poker hand to make according to what bets are on the table
2. Cutscenes and transitions between battles
3. A way to change to player's bets (e.g., a shop, end battle reward, etc.)
4. More types of bets (like copying the enemy's bet, adding block, etc.)
