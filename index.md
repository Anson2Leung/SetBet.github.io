## Overview


## Game Introduction
Set bet is a deckbuilder roguelike that takes inspiration from games like Balatro and Dicey Dungeon. The player can place down bets that trigger a variety of effects, like copying adjacent bets, dealing damage, drawing cards, and so on, if they have the appropriate poker hand. The game currently features an endless set of enemies with randomized bets that scale in health with each win, so see how far you can get.
